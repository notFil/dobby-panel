# Dobby Panel

Like Dobby, the wonderful house elf, the Dobby Panel is a mini helper. This devtool panel extension aids in web application security testing, its aim is to help make those tedious tasks a little bit easier. It's similar to the awesome HackBar extension on Firefox.

This project is still a working progress so there are lots of bugs, and missing features.
